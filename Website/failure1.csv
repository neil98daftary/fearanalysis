Do what I have to do to resolve the situation,1
Handle it like it was second nature to me,1
Not consider failure a possibility and get into it ,1
Do it since I am well equipped to take up the responsibility,1
Accept responsibility apprehensively and look for someone else to help me,3
Hesitantly do it after carefully considering the consequences,3
Do it if I had no other choice,3
Let someone else handle it,5
Iâ€™m ill-equipped to take up the challenge,5
Not even try,5
Would pass the position of responsibility to someone better,5
I always actively avoid high stakes situations,5
